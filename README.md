# 💸 UPIWise – Your Smart UPI Spending Assistant

**UPIWise** is a smart add-on layer for existing UPI apps that helps users stay financially mindful by identifying and controlling impulsive spending in real-time.

## 🚀 What is UPIWise?

UPIWise is an AI-powered assistant that classifies your UPI transactions as **"needs"** or **"wants"** the moment you scan a vendor's QR code. Using a powerful LLM (Large Language Model) backend, it delivers real-time, context-aware recommendations that help you make smarter financial decisions.

## 🔍 How It Works

- 🧠 **LLM-Powered Classification**  
  Every transaction is instantly analyzed and labeled as a *need* or a *want*.

- 🚦 **Impulse Control Alerts**  
  If a *want* exceeds your configured savings threshold, UPIWise gently nudges you with a warning message.

- 📊 **Mindful Spending Tracker**  
  Keep track of how much you’ve spent on wants vs. needs, helping you reflect on spending patterns.
